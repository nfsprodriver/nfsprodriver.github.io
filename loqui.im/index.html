	    <p>Contrary to what Mozilla had initially communicated, they have now completely shut down the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/">Marketplace</a> for any updates! Unfortunately, screwed up again by <strong>Mozilla</strong>.</p>

	    </header>
	    <p>We are working very hard on implementing the new transport protocol based on Noise Pipes which will be required by the end of the year when WhatsApp discontinues support for older phones like the Nokia S40 platform.</p>

	    </header>
	    <p>Loqui IM 0.5.6 is now able to work around serious brokenness on Orange KLIF phones due to those phones implementing the WebCrypto API incorrectly. Loqui IM was already able to detect and work around missing support for the WebCrypto API since 0.5.2, but didn't expect to get a broken implementation.</p>

	    </header>
	    <p>We are still catching up with protocol changes due to enforced end-to-end encryption by WhatsApp. One-to-one messages should mostly be working fine now, but we still can't handle encrypted group messages. On top of that Firefox Marketplace app reviews always take a long time...</p>

	      <h2>WhatsApp to Land on FirefoxOS as a Loqui IM Service Provider</h2>
	      <span>Written by <a href="http://github.com/waalt" target="_blank">waaltcom</a> on Nov. 15, 2013</span>
	    </header>
	    <p> In the last months we have heard a whole lot of unfounded gossips about the arrival of WhatsApp to FirefoxOS. But certainly, until today, the only official statement in this matter was an apparently definitive refusal of its owner company 'WhatsApp Inc.' to port their app to the newborn web-based mobile platform alleging that they "are not sure if the investment worths it".</p>
	    <p>Now we have decided to include the celebrated messaging service inside the Loqui IM app, adding it to the increasingly extensive list of supported providers (Hangouts, Microsoft Lync, Nokia ovi, Nimbuzz and now WhatsApp).</p>
      <p>We know there are other apps that connects to WhatsApp in the Firefox Marketplace, but there's a huge technical difference. Loqui IM connects to WhatsApp servers through TCP sockets and without any kind of intermediary or proxy. WhatsApp can't tell our app from the original one in no way and thus they can't block users who are not connecting from it.</p>
      <p>According to our release schedule, the new update will be published in the Firefox Marketplace by the end of November, though the source code will be available some days before through the Loqui repository on GitHub.</p>
      <p>This announcement, that coincides with the sixth moth since Loqui was published, was made in the context of an event that took place in the Medialab of the self-managed social center 'La Casa Invisible' in Málaga and was organized in collaboration with the hackers from the nonprofit organization 'BitValley.cc'.</p>
      <p>We take the occasion to say in advance that other providers may be supported "quite soon" and we are about to add many other features such as group chat, videocalls using the new WebRTC standard and end-to-end encription with OTR.<p>
      <p>Finally we also want to thank every individual who has contributed to the Loqui's early success: from those who have reported or even fixed bugs to those who have translated the app to nine different languages.</p>
